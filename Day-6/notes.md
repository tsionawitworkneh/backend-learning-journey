# Day 7 – HTTP & Node.js Server

## What is HTTP?
HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is how clients (browser, mobile apps)
communicate with servers.

## Client–Server Model
- Client sends a request
- Server processes it
- Server sends a response

## HTTP Methods
- GET → Read data
- POST → Send data
- PUT → Update data
- DELETE → Remove data

## Status Codes
- 200 → OK
- 201 → Created
- 400 → Bad Request
- 404 → Not Found
- 500 → Server Error

## Node.js HTTP Module
Node.js provides the `http` module to create servers without frameworks.
