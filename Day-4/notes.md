# Day 5 – Node.js Core Modules (fs & path)

## What is fs?
`fs` (File System) allows Node.js to:
- Read files
- Write files
- Create folders
- Delete files

## What is path?
`path` helps handle file paths safely across operating systems.

## Why this matters in backend
- Logging data
- Saving user uploads
- Reading configuration files

## What I did today
- Used fs to write and read a file
- Used path to handle file paths
