# Day 1 – Backend & TypeScript Basics

## What is Backend?
The backend is the part of a web application that runs on the server.  
It is responsible for:
- Handling requests from clients (browser, mobile app)
- Processing business logic
- Working with databases
- Sending responses back

## What is Node.js?
Node.js is a runtime that allows JavaScript to run on the server instead of the browser.

It is used to:
- Build APIs
- Connect to databases
- Handle users and authentication

## What is TypeScript?
TypeScript is a strongly typed version of JavaScript.
It helps:
- Catch errors early
- Make code easier to understand
- Build large applications safely

Example:
```ts
let age: number = 20;   // TypeScript
let name: string = "Kebron";
