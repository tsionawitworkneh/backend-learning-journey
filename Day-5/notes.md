# Day 5 – Asynchronous Programming in Node.js

## What is synchronous code?
Synchronous code blocks execution until the task is finished.

Example:
- Read file
- Wait
- Continue

## What is asynchronous code?
Asynchronous code allows Node.js to continue executing other tasks
while waiting for slow operations (files, databases, network).

## Why async is important
- Backend servers handle many users
- Blocking code makes the server slow

## Async patterns in Node.js
1. Callbacks
2. Promises
3. Async / Await (most used)

## What I did today
- Used setTimeout
- Used Promise
- Used async/await
